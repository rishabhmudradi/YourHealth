# YourHealth

## Overview
An average screening for a simple disease from a professional clinic can range between $416 to $1,000+. Lower income familes don't have the luxury to pay for many of these tests and families with insurance are still left up to dry. Additionally, screenings may take long amounts of time with patients running from clinic to clinic to get input on results. We decided to develop YourHealth, an iOS application that is the hub for all medical treatment. Our features provide users with feasibility to receive accurate results with the snap of a picture and have the ability to contact certified doctors straight through our app. We also provide security with our backend authentication and database filtering through users and removing stored test results.
